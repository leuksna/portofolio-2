				<h4>About ME</h4>
		
				<p> After my baccalaureate at age 17, I decided to start traveling and experience other cultures, foods and ways of life. 
I wanted to open myself to the world and to different value so that I could really experience for myself what is out there and develop my own critical mind.  
By meeting many different people from different places, I came to realize that essentially, we have more similarities than we are led to believe, it is important to always hear all narrative before to make any assumption, and kindness and hard work rules over all. 

I have been working as a chef for the past 8 years and what fulfil me the most in this work was to create something from scratch and see it develop to a final product. I also loved the team spirit; everyone had their role in the great machine that a professional kitchen is and it was beautiful to work together toward a goal. 

During my Free time I enjoy being creative, whether it is making music, furniture, graphic design or fashion. I just enjoy to create beautiful and functional things. I also have an interest for science et Technologie, that’s why I feel I would perfectly fit the role of a Front-end developer. My goal is to become financially stable while working a job that fulfil me. </p>

			<p>I had the chance to be selected to participate in Le Wagon workshop - Women Coding Night- where we proceed to code our first web page. I really loved that during the workshop we naturally helped one another when we didn't understand something. </p>
